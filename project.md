# Term Project

The converting [Glass of Water by aXel](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/resources/) scene to our XML format is my term project.

As seen, it includes glass types objects. Unfortunately, I could not find the gaze vector or gaze point and near distance by using the world matrix given in the original work. I completed all fields except camera properties in the XML file and assumed the camera properties and tried to produce a scene. But, I could not achieve it.
