# Advanced Ray Tracer

In computer graphics, ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. (from Wikipedia)

In this serial, I'll share my experiences while developing an Advanced Ray Tracer.

Sections:

1. [Basic Ray Tracer](page1.md) includes diffuse shading, specular (Blinn-Phong) shading, and ambient shading

1. [Reflection and Refraction with Ray Tracer Acceleration](page2.md) includes reflection and refraction shadings with Fresnel coefficient, Snell's and Beer's laws. In addition, ray tracer is accelerated via Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. 

My development environment is Ubuntu18.4

Required Libraries are libpng-dev and libtinyxml-dev.
